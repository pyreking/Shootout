bin/pull_files.sh: 

Downloads the latest version of the HTML files, regardless of whether or 
not the local copy has changed. NHL.com does not utilize an "If-Modified-
Since" header, as the tables are generated on-the-fly. Without it, there is 
no way to tell when the web page has been modified.

bin/update.sh:

files. This script will not execute unless there is a connection to my home 
Wi-Fi.

bin/backup.sh:

Stages any modified or deleted files, and commits the changes with an 
automated message. This script excludes any changes to files listed under 
the src and bin directories, as well as files with the .gp extension.
