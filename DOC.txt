bin/pull_files.sh: 

Downloads the latest version of the HTML files, regardless of whether or 
not the local copy has changed. NHL.com does not utilize an "If-Modified-
Since" header, as the tables are generated on-the-fly. Without it, there is 
no way to tell when the web page has been modified.

bin/update.sh:

Updates the local directory with new versions of the HTML, CSV, and SVG 
files. This script will not execute unless there is a connection to my home 
Wi-Fi.

bin/backup.sh:

Stages any modified or deleted files, and commits the changes with an 
automated message. This script excludes any changes to files listed under 
the src directory.
